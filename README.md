# Imovie
imovie is an application where a user can search about movies where movies contains with title name, director name, imdb rating, and release date with movie poster.

# Technical Description
Developed an Angular application that includes the distinct components that serve different purposes within my application. For example, a navigation component, a data display component, and a feedback form component. Within my service, I made one HTTP request to an external API and mock server to fetch or send data and display the result of this HTTP request in component. My application's UI clearly displays the functionality of each component and the result of the HTTP request. Aim for a user-friendly and intuitive design. I deployed my application to a free hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
